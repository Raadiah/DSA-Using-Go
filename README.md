# Implementation of Different Data Structures and Algorithms using Go

In this project, we will implement different Data Structures and Algorithms using Go. We will be using the ***Fundamentals of Computer Algorithms***  by *E. Horowitz et.al* as a reference book.

This will be a command line tool programming. Let's dive into it
