# Stack Data Structure

Stack is a list of data, where an item is inserted and extracted from the top. It is like a stack of Plates. The plate is always placed on the top, and taken away from the top. Since the last item is taken out first, it is also knos as Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.

The insert and extract operation is constant time O(1), independent of the length of the stack.

A stack can be implemented in two ways:

- Using Array
- Using Linked List
